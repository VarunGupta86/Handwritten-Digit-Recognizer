# Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based digit recognizer built with TensorFlow and trained on the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses MNIST data
- Trains a CNN to classify handwritten digits (0-9)
- Evaluates model performance
- Predicts digits from test data and custom images
- Visualization of results

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pillow
- tk
- ipykernel

Install all dependencies with: pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-digit-recognizer.git
    cd handwritten-digit-recognizer
    ```
2. Install the dependencies
3. Run the main notebook `digit_recognizer.ipynb` or Python script
4. Follow instructions in code to train, test, and try custom images

## Output & Results

- Achieved accuracy: ~98% on MNIST test data
- Example predictions included in results

# Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based digit recognizer built with TensorFlow and trained on the MNIST dataset.

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a system that accurately classifies handwritten digits from images. The model is trained on the popular MNIST dataset and is capable of predicting digits from both standard test set images and custom input images provided by users.

---

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset
- Trains a Convolutional Neural Network for digit recognition
- Evaluates performance on unseen test images
- Supports prediction on custom user-uploaded images
- Visualizes predictions and model accuracy

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pillow
- tk
- ipykernel

Install all dependencies with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-digit-recognizer.git
    cd handwritten-digit-recognizer
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the notebook/script:**
    - Open `Handwritten Digit Recognizer.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab or click the link to view it in colab:[Click Here üëÜ](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DNnk9IyRta9K9pcw5lELfE4mqu1wI2RT?usp=sharing)
    - If using a `.py` script, run: `main.py` in your IDE.

## üìù Usage

- The notebook/script walks you through:
    - Loading and preprocessing MNIST data
    - Building and training the CNN model
    - Evaluating accuracy on test data
    - Trying out predictions on your own custom digit images

---

## Output & Results

- Achieved accuracy: ~98% on MNIST test data
- Example predictions included in results
